# GTA V Mods

In this directory you will find several of my projects for GTA V. These range from texture edits, xml mods,
to even a couple of 3D modeling projects. My Releases folder contains the actual mods I've released on GTA5-Mods.com.
The rest are for my personal use.

1: Releases

   The "Releases" is my folder containing the official releases of my mods for GTA5-Mods.com. 
   
   This encompasses the following directories: Chrome Colors, Colored Chrome Paint, Colored Window Tint, 
   Colored Xenon Lights, Pure Black Window Tint.
   
   You can see pictures and descriptions of each mod at the links provided above.
                                        
2: 3D Projects
   
   The directories Concave Wheel, Specialty Forged, Sultan RS V8, Vanilla Wheels, and Wheels Mods all
   contain a few of my 3D modeling projects.
   
   These are not from-scratch models. Rather, they are edits I've done to existing models that I've purchased
   or have taken from GTA V. I purchased some wheels from the popular GTA V modder GODzGIFT, and also recieved
   personal coaching from him on how to work zmodeler to edit the models. All credits to their respective authors.
   
   You need zmodeler to view any of the files in here. See "Screenshots" at the root of the repo to see some examples.

3: Texture Work

   The folders Fuel Textures and new sherifflights contain my texture mods for GTA V. 
   
   For the sheriff lights, I took the original DDS textures from GTA V and edited the colors of the police lightbar flashers.
   They were originally an odd orange/sky blue combo, so I made them true red and blue. You can see photos in "Screenshots"
   
   For Fuel Textures, I was working with GODzGIFT on a wheel model, when he purchased a new Fuel Offroad tire model. However, 
   he didn't have any Fuel tire textures, only Toyo textures. So I made a deal with him that I'd create some Fuel tire
   textures in exchange for the new Fuel tire model. Using Photoshop, I took the Toyo textures and edited them by adding
   in the Fuel logo. I couldn't find a clear picture of the GRIPPER M/T text, so I had to replicate it from scratch. Once
   that was done, I had to use an external generator to create specular and normal maps for the tires. You can see photos 
   in "Screenshots".
